        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>Rosemary stalks</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>6 large potatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the roasted potatoes, peel the skin off and cut them into your preferred size, placing them in the bowl of water once cut.</li>
            <li>Then, rinse and drain the potatoes once again and put them into a clean bowl.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a few pinches of fine salt over the potatoes, rubbing it over them really well, mixing it through using your hands.</li>
            <li>Transfer the potatoes into an oven safe baking tray and spread them out, before adding a few short rosemary stalks and garlic cloves (with the skin still on, making a small slit with a knife).</li>
            <li>Braise the roasted potatoes at a medium heat on the stove top, mixing and turning them with a fork every so often, for up to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the braised potatoes in the oven to cook for up to 30 minutes or until they are crispy and golden.</li>
            <li>Once the roasted potatoes are cooked, remove them from the oven.</li>
        </ol>
