# odin-recipes
The Odin Project (Recipe Project)
Currently, with this project the aim is to utilize HTML to create a website where I can access three different recipes. It will look rudimentary with my current skillset, but I should be able to polish it up after taking the HTML course and then moving onto CSS.
